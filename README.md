SaberBot is a Discord bot written in python 3 using [discord.py API wrapper](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/). This bot is written using current version of discord.py, and it was written to suit my own needs.

### Install  ###
```git clone https://github.com/mmmalk/saberbot´´´

Remember to edit the config.ini to suit your own needs - at least you'll need an [api key](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro) from discord.

### Dependencies ###
* [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord)
